Java Array:

==>Normally, array is a collection of similar type of elements that have contiguous memory location.

==>Java array is an object the contains elements of similar data type. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only fixed set of elements in a java array.

==>Array in java is index based, first element of the array is stored at 0 index.


Advantage of Java Array:

==>Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data easily.
==>Random access: We can get any data located at any index position.

Disadvantage of Java Array:

==>Size Limit: We can store only fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in java.
